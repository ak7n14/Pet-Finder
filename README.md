The project aims to explore different machine learning techniques in order to predict certain outcomes from a given dataset. We go through the machine learning process of data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering and extraction, and comparison of different models. The dataset chosen was taken from a Kaggle competition that aims to predict the how fast a pet will get adopted.
